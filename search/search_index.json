Overview # Image tab # Via File -> Open scan... , you can load an ENVI file representing a sample scan for viewing. Depending on your locators for the black/white references, you may need to load the black/white reference ENVI files manually. Some black/white reference methods rely on From that menu, you can also open black and white reference ENVI files that get applied to the scan, according to the : At the bottom of the window, you get a quick info on what dimensions the scan has (width, height and channels). The three sliders allow you to select the channels from the hyperspectral image to act as red, green and blue channel for the fake RGB image that is being displayed. Left-clicking on the label next to the slider, depicting the current channel value, pops up a dialog for entering a specific channel. If default bands are defined in the ENVI header and auto-detect channels is enabled on the Options tab , then these will get used when loading the file. Info tab # On the Info tab, you can see what files are currently loaded and what dimensions these files have: Options tab # On the Options tab, you can change various settings: General Auto-detect channels: uses any suggested channels from the meta-data of a scan Keep aspect ratio: whether to maintain width/height ratio of the scan or let the image fill the available canvas space Check scan dimensions: when checked and the dimensions of a subsequently loaded scan differs, a warning dialog will be displayed Auto-load annotations: when checked any available pixel or polygon annotations for scan, black and white reference get loaded automatically Predefined labels: comma-separated list of labels to use in the annotation process SAM connection parameters black reference location and method plugin white reference location and method plugin Preprocessing plugins Normalization plugin (gets applied before creating RGB image) Annotations # The Envi Viewer supports two types of annotations that can be exported: pixel-level: for disjointed/scattered regions of interest, e.g., ragged outlines of plants polygon-based: for well-defined shapes, like white references or shards of materials What type of annotations is active is managed via the Mode menu, where you can choose between Pixels and Polygons . Markers # Regardless of annotation mode, markers can be set on the scan image, as these markers are used as points of interest for displaying raw/processed spectra. left-clicking on the image sets a marker point. left-clicking while holding the CTRL key removes any marker points. Pixels # Ensure that you have switched to Pixels mode. Annotating pixels is done with these mouse actions: SHIFT+left-click: paints the pixels at the current location using the current brush and label; you can also drag the mouse while holding the keys to keep painting. CTRL+SHIFT+left-click: acts as eraser , removing any differently colored pixels at the current location SHIFT+right-click: performs flood fill at the current location, e.g., for filling in the center of an object after tracing the outline Before you start annotating, you should consider: Whether the cursor is better to see in black or white ( Pixels > Brush color ). Whether the cursor shape should be round or square ( Pixels > Brush shape ). What size the cursor should be ( Pixels > Brush size ; use an odd number as size to have a center from which to paint). Filling out centers of objects tends to be easier with a larger brush, before filling in the edges with a smaller one. Select the correct label for your annotations ( Pixels > Select label ). Using Pixels > Label key you can view a chart with the labels associated with their colors. Below is an annotation in progress: Once you are finished with the annotations, you can export them as ENVI file via: File > Export > Pixel annotations Polygons # Ensure that you have switched to Polygons mode. Polygons get created from markers as follows: Add markers in clockwise order where the vertices of the polygon should be, e.g., for outlining the white reference in the scan below: With at least three markers present, press CTRL+P or choose Add polygon from the Polygons menu to turn the markers into a polygon: You can assign a label to a polygon by left-clicking on the polygon while holding the SHIFT key. The labels whiteref and blackref are reserved keywords and used for white/black reference annotations. The labels available from the dropdown list are based on the predefined labels from the Options tab. Once a label has been selected and the dialog accepted, the label will be displayed in the center of the polygon: Apart from polygons, you can also create rectangles by using two markers for the top-left and bottom-right corners and then select Polygons > Add rectangle from the menu (or Ctrl+R). A useful feature when planning on exporting sub-images. Once you are finished with the annotations, you can export them as OPEX JSON file via: File > Export > Polygon annotations SAM # Using SAM , you can easily annotate complex shapes accurately. Though SAM can run on a CPU, it is recommended to use a computer with a NVIDIA GPU as it will speed up the detection process by at least 10 times. SAM requires you to at least provide a single marker on the object that you want to trace the shape for. Depending on the object and how well it is separated from the background, how much the colors on the object change, you may have to provide more than one marker point to better guide the detection: The result looks then like this: When in Pixels annotation mode, the polygons detected by SAM will be drawn as pixels: Sub-images export # When imaging multiple samples within a single scan, you can use the Sub-images export facility to separate out the sub-samples. The export requires the sub-samples to be annotated. Therefore, you need to: annotate each sub-sample with a rectangle: mark top-left and bottom-right corner and then select Add rectangle from the Polygons menu (or use CTRL+R shortcut) use the ID of the sub-sample as the label for the rectangle (SHIFT+left-click) Once all sub-samples have been annotate, export the polygon annotations and select File > Export > Sub-images from the menu: Select the directory to export the sub-samples to The Label regexp is a regular expression for identifying the labels in your annotations that represent the sub-samples. If you have no other annotations present, you can simply leave it empty. If that is not the case and your sub-samples are label with integers, you can use [0-9]+ . If you want to export the raw data, i.e., the original scan data, then tick the Use raw data checkbox. Otherwise, any changes from applying black/white reference and preprocessors will get output. Specify the writer and its parameters that you want to use for the export. See section Writer examples below the screenshot for some examples.
