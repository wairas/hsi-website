# Overview

## Image tab

Via *File -> Open scan...*, you can load an ENVI file representing a sample scan for viewing.

Depending on your locators for the black/white references, you may need
to load the black/white reference ENVI files manually. Some black/white
reference methods rely on 
From that menu, you can also open black and white reference ENVI files that
get applied to the scan, according to the :

![Envi Viewer - image tab](img/envi_viewer-scan.png)

At the bottom of the window, you get a quick info on what dimensions the
scan has (width, height and channels). 

The three sliders allow you to select the channels from the hyperspectral 
image to act as red, green and blue channel for the fake RGB image that is 
being displayed. Left-clicking on the label next to the slider, depicting
the current channel value, pops up a dialog for entering a specific channel.
If *default bands* are defined in the ENVI header and *auto-detect channels*
is enabled on the *Options tab*, then these will get used when loading the
file.


## Info tab

On the *Info* tab, you can see what files are currently loaded and what 
dimensions these files have:

![Envi Viewer - info tab](img/envi_viewer-info.png)


## Options tab

On the *Options* tab, you can change various settings:

* General
  
    * Auto-detect channels: uses any suggested channels from the meta-data of a scan
    * Keep aspect ratio: whether to maintain width/height ratio of the scan or let the image fill the available canvas space
    * Check scan dimensions: when checked and the dimensions of a subsequently loaded scan differs, a warning dialog will be displayed
    * Auto-load annotations: when checked any available pixel or polygon annotations for scan, black and white reference get loaded automatically
    * Predefined labels: comma-separated list of labels to use in the annotation process 

* [SAM](../sam.md) connection parameters
* black reference [location](https://github.com/wairas/happy-tools/tree/main/plugins#reference-locators) and [method](https://github.com/wairas/happy-tools/tree/main/plugins#black-reference-methods) plugin
* white reference [location](https://github.com/wairas/happy-tools/tree/main/plugins#reference-locators) and [method](https://github.com/wairas/happy-tools/tree/main/plugins#white-reference-methods) plugin
* [Preprocessing](https://github.com/wairas/happy-tools/tree/main/plugins#happy-data-preprocessors) plugins
* [Normalization](https://github.com/wairas/happy-tools/tree/main/plugins#normalizations) plugin (gets applied before creating RGB image)

# Annotations

The Envi Viewer supports two types of annotations that can be exported:

* pixel-level: for disjointed/scattered regions of interest, e.g., ragged outlines of plants
* polygon-based: for well-defined shapes, like white references or shards of materials

What type of annotations is active is managed via the *Mode* menu, where you
can choose between *Pixels* and *Polygons*.

## Markers

Regardless of annotation mode, *markers* can be set on the scan image, as these
markers are used as points of interest for displaying raw/processed spectra.

* left-clicking on the image sets a marker point.
* left-clicking while holding the CTRL key removes any marker points.


## Pixels

Ensure that you have switched to *Pixels* mode.

Annotating pixels is done with these mouse actions:

* SHIFT+left-click: paints the pixels at the current location using the current 
  brush and label; you can also drag the mouse while holding the keys to keep painting.
* CTRL+SHIFT+left-click: acts as *eraser*, removing any differently colored pixels 
  at the current location
* SHIFT+right-click: performs flood fill at the current location, e.g., for filling
  in the center of an object after tracing the outline

Before you start annotating, you should consider:

* Whether the cursor is better to see in black or white (*Pixels > Brush color*).
* Whether the cursor shape should be round or square (*Pixels > Brush shape*).
* What size the cursor should be (*Pixels > Brush size*; use an odd number as size to 
  have a center from which to paint). Filling out centers of objects tends to 
  be easier with a larger brush, before filling in the edges with a smaller one.
* Select the correct label for your annotations (*Pixels > Select label*). Using
  *Pixels > Label key* you can view a chart with the labels associated with their
  colors.

Below is an annotation in progress:

![Envi Viewer - pixel annotation in progress](img/envi_viewer-pixels1.png)

Once you are finished with the annotations, you can export them as ENVI file via:

*File > Export > Pixel annotations*


## Polygons

Ensure that you have switched to *Polygons* mode.

Polygons get created from markers as follows:

1. Add markers in clockwise order where the vertices of the polygon should be, 
   e.g., for outlining the white reference in the scan below:

   ![Envi Viewer - polygon markers](img/envi_viewer-polygon1.png)

2. With at least three markers present, press CTRL+P or choose *Add polygon* 
   from the *Polygons* menu to turn the markers into a polygon:

   ![Envi Viewer - polygon annotation](img/envi_viewer-polygon2.png)

3. You can assign a label to a polygon by left-clicking on the polygon while
   holding the SHIFT key. The labels `whiteref` and `blackref` are reserved
   keywords and used for white/black reference annotations. The labels available
   from the dropdown list are based on the predefined labels from the *Options* tab.

   ![Envi Viewer - label dialog](img/envi_viewer-polygon3.png)

4. Once a label has been selected and the dialog accepted, the label will be displayed
   in the center of the polygon:

   ![Envi Viewer - labelled polygon](img/envi_viewer-polygon4.png)

Apart from polygons, you can also create rectangles by using two markers for 
the top-left and bottom-right corners and then select *Polygons > Add rectangle*
from the menu (or Ctrl+R). A useful feature when planning on exporting sub-images.

Once you are finished with the annotations, you can export them as 
[OPEX JSON](https://github.com/waikato-datamining/fast-opex) file via:

*File > Export > Polygon annotations*


## SAM

Using [SAM](../sam.md), you can easily annotate complex shapes accurately.
Though SAM can run on a CPU, it is recommended to use a computer with a
NVIDIA GPU as it will speed up the detection process by at least 10 times.

SAM requires you to at least provide a single marker on the object that you
want to trace the shape for. Depending on the object and how well it is 
separated from the background, how much the colors on the object change, you
may have to provide more than one marker point to better guide the detection:

![Envi Viewer - polygon markers](img/envi_viewer-sam1.png)

The result looks then like this:

![Envi Viewer - detected polygon](img/envi_viewer-sam2.png)

When in *Pixels* annotation mode, the polygons detected by SAM will be 
drawn as pixels:

![Envi Viewer - detected pixels](img/envi_viewer-sam3.png)


# Sub-images export

When imaging multiple samples within a single scan, you can use the
*Sub-images* export facility to separate out the sub-samples.

The export requires the sub-samples to be annotated. Therefore, you need to:

* annotate each sub-sample with a rectangle: mark top-left and bottom-right corner
  and then select *Add rectangle* from the *Polygons* menu (or use CTRL+R shortcut)
* use the ID of the sub-sample as the label for the rectangle (SHIFT+left-click)

Once all sub-samples have been annotate, export the polygon annotations and
select *File > Export > Sub-images* from the menu:

* Select the directory to export the sub-samples to
* The *Label regexp* is a [regular expression](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.search) 
  for identifying the labels in your annotations that represent the sub-samples. 
  If you have no other annotations present, you can simply leave it empty. 
  If that is not the case and your sub-samples are label with integers, you can use `[0-9]+`.
* If you want to export the *raw* data, i.e., the original scan data, then tick
  the *Use raw data* checkbox. Otherwise, any changes from applying black/white
  reference and preprocessors will get output.
* Specify the [writer](https://github.com/wairas/happy-tools/tree/main/plugins#happy-data-writers)
  and its parameters that you want to use for the export. See section *Writer examples* 
  below the screenshot for some examples.

The following screenshot exports the spectral data from the annotated sub-samples
as CSV:

![Envi Viewer - sub-images export dialog](img/envi_viewer-subimages_export.png)

## Writer examples

**Note:** the `{BASEDIR}` placeholder used in `-o` parameters will get replaced
by the selected output directory.

* Happy data: `happy-writer`
* ENVI: `envi-writer`
* PNG: `png-writer`
* JPG: `image-writer -o {BASEDIR}/{SAMPLEID}.{REGIONID}.jpg`
* CSV: `csv-writer -o {BASEDIR}/{SAMPLEID}.{REGIONID}.csv`
* CSV (combined sub-samples): `csv-writer -o {BASEDIR}/{SAMPLEID}.csv`
