Welcome to the Hyperspectral Imaging Group at the University of Waikato. We are 
a team of engineers and computer scientists working on computational imaging 
methods for  hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technology through open-source platforms. 
We prioritise software-hardware integrated methods with machine learning and 
AI-informed image acquisition protocols. Our website serves as a hub for our 
software, hardware and hyperspectral database.

# HAPPy Software
We have developed an in-house [HAPPy software](happy/index.md), which is 
abbreviation for *Hyperspectral Applications Platform in Python*. This is a 
platform that streamlines the workflow for hyperspectral data acquisition, 
annotation, analysis, and the exploration of machine learning algorithms. 
HAPPy is intended to allow non-experts to interface easily with our specialised 
toolboxes, models and algorithms to facilitate quicker experimentation and 
innovation in HSI.

# Our Hardware
We have [2 hyperspectral cameras](hardware.md) alongside a custom multi-instrument 
laboratory system for these cameras, and portable in-field imaging. Our hardware 
includes the Specim IQ camera (400-1000nm), the Specim FX-17 camera (900-1700nm), 
a rotary stage, and multiple halogen lighitng systems to capture high-quality 
hyperspectral data.
